# Nuxt Auth Module example (V4.9.1)

this is a demo of the nuxt-auth module. 

in `master` there is the standard example for 4.9.1.
in `develop` there is an updated example from v5 with some settings from 4.9.1

therefore your are better off by using the `master`-branch.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
